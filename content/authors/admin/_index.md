I am currently pursuing a Master's degree at KAIST in <a href="https://nmsl.kaist.ac.kr/">Network & Mobile Systems Lab (NMSL)</a> under the guidance of Professor <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/wewantsj/">Sung-Ju Lee</a>. I received my B.S. degree in Computer Science from KAIST in 2022.
{style="text-align: justify;"}

 My research centers on machine learning, mobile sensing, and natural language processing. I am interested in making practical systems that can directly benefit the end users. My current research focuses on federated learning, particularly addressing the label deficiency challenges for making practical FL systems.
