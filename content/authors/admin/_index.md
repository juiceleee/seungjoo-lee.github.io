I am a graduate student researcher at the <a href="https://nmsl.kaist.ac.kr/">Network & Mobile Systems Lab (NMSL)</a>, <a href="https://www.kaist.ac.kr/en/">KAIST</a>, where I work under the guidance of Professor <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/wewantsj/">Sung-Ju Lee</a>. Currently, I am a research intern at <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-asia/">Microsoft Research</a>, mentored by <a href="https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~lili/">Lili Qiu</a>. I received an M.S. degree in Electrical Engineering from <a href="https://www.kaist.ac.kr/en/">KAIST</a> and a B.S. degree in Computer Science from the same institution with <span style="font-weight: bold !important;">Summa Cum Laude</span> and <span style="font-weight: bold !important;">Honor (Winner of the Graduate of the Year)</span>.




{style="text-align: justify;"}

My research interest lies in machine learning for healthcare, mobile sensing, federated learning and large language models. I am passionate about building practical machine learning systems designed for real-world deployment to improve individual lives. Recently, I have been working on advancing Federated Learning (FL) for medical applications and developing foundation models for healthcare, particularly using sensor data.
