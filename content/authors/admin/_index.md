I am currently pursuing a Master's degree at KAIST in <a href="https://nmsl.kaist.ac.kr/">Network & Mobile Systems Lab (NMSL)</a> under the guidance of Professor <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/wewantsj/">Sung-Ju Lee</a>. I received my B.S. degree in Computer Science from KAIST in 2022.

 My research centers on <b>Federated Learning</b> (FL), with a particular emphasis on enhancing its practicality. I believe that the widespread adoption of FL systems can unlock innovative possibilities in our daily lives. My current research focuses on addressing the label deficiency challenges within FL systems.
